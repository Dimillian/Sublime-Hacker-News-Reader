This is my first public Python project, well this is my first Python project ever, I'm open to any constructive criticism. I think the code is currently bad, but I've mad it for myself first, and its works, so I'm fine. 
I'll make i.e. better with more features. Maybe soon, maybe later.

This plugin is not in Package Control yet, I'll submit it soon, this version or a later one.
